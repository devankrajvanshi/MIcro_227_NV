# Quantum Computation in Diamond NV Centers
## EE227 Course Project

This repo contains final report and poster for presentation of our reading project. Here we have 

* Studied the unique properties of Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres which allow robust, room-temperature operation of solid-state qubits and their demonstrations in quantum information processing
* Researched about recent advances in magnetic & optical manipulation of the NV centerâ€™s quantum spin
* Understood how quantum control of individual centers can be harnessed for the protection of NV-center spin coherence and for multi-qubit quantum operations in the presence of decoherence.
